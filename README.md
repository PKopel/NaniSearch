# NaniSaerch

Text game based on ["Adventure in Prolog"](https://www.amzi.com/AdventureInProlog/index.php) tutorial, written in SWI Prolog.

## Running

To run the game run `make run` in repository root folder.


If you can't use `make`, start SWIPL repl in repository root folder and load file nani_search.pl (with `swipl -s src/nani_search.pl` in terminal or `[src/nani_search].` in repl), and then type `start.`. The game ends when you find the nani or when you type `end`.
